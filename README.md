#Project Euler Answers
For those unfamiliar, [Project Euler] (https://projecteuler.net/archives) is a website containing many math problems for the user to solve. The solving of these problems is facilitated with a programming language.

#So what's this?
This repository is a collection of my personal answers to each question, written in Python. The number of files will be updated as I progress through the problems. 
I have also posted a number of my answers within the actual Project Euler forums, although those are only accessible once you have completed the respective question.
